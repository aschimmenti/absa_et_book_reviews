    "review_text": "While I had high hopes for James Hilton's work, I found it lacking in depth. The adventure fiction genre is usually thrilling, but this story felt a bit flat. However, the visionary and metaphysical elements were intriguing, offering a glimpse into a world that could have been more fully realized. The setting in the snow-capped mountains of Tibet was captivating, but the characters didn't quite resonate with me. Overall, it had potential but didn't quite deliver.",
