Incorporate the specified aspects naturally into the review by using the input aspects and their categorization as a guardrail on how to refer it into the text. \n\nThis is mandatory, and you will be evaluated on this aspect. Treat the given review as a template: mantain its register (serious if serious, funny if funny). Remember to sound natural! \n3. Use the given review as inspiration to sound as authentic as a real reader.\n4. Use natural language and a conversational tone similar to the provided example review. Do not add aspects or categories that are not in the given set of aspects.  \n6. The review should be around 150 words in length, no longer than the given review to use. \n7.

The author's style is so similar to Joyce's stream of consciousness and the plot kept me guessing. The portrayal of mental illness and the character of Alicia Berenson are particularly compelling. The romantic elements blend beautifully with the darker themes. However, I found the book's take on democracy's issues rather simplistic and unconvincing. The genre is very young adult tbh.
