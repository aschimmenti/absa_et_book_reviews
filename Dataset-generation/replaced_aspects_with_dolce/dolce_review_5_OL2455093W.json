    "review_text": "In 'Lost Horizon', James Hilton crafts a captivating tale that transports readers to the mystical Shangri-La. The adventure fiction genre shines through with its rich descriptions and intriguing characters. However, I found that the plot felt a bit predictable at times, lacking the twists I hoped for. Despite this, Hilton's ability to create a vivid world makes it a worthwhile read for anyone seeking an escape into a hidden paradise. Overall, it's a delightful journey that showcases Hilton's talent as a storyteller.",
