    "review_text": "James Hilton's storytelling is truly captivating. The way he weaves a visionary and metaphysical narrative around the hidden community of Shangri-La is nothing short of brilliant. The characters' journey through the uncharted mountains is both thrilling and thought-provoking. While the genre leans towards lost world fiction, it offers so much more in terms of depth and exploration of human nature. I found myself completely immersed in this enchanting tale, and it left me pondering long after I turned the last page.",
