0142800376	A2UV33NZC4HC53	False	01 10, 2006	1136851200	5.0	2	 Paperback	Awsome book	"The book starts where The Gunslinger left off with Roland on the beach thinking about what the man in black said. Soon Roland starts along the beach but is met with a lobster like creature you cuts off a couple of his fingers. After this he stays away from the water and is more careful on hi journey to find the three people. The first of these people is Eddie Dean who comes from New York and is ""The Prisoner"", which he is a prisoner of heroin. When Roland first enters Eddie's mind he his on a plane, or sky carriage as Roland knows it. Eddie is carrying drugs with him and when it comes time to get off the plane he freaks out, so Roland makes himself known and helps Eddie out. While Eddie goes through customs Roland says he can stash the cocaine with him in his world. After Eddie clears customs he tells Roland that he has to go to Balazar, the guy who Eddie is selling the cocaine to.  Eddie is taken to Balazar by a couple of guys, Col Vincent and Jack Andolini. Once at Balazar's Eddie made sure the deal was still on that he would give Balazar the cocaine and return he would give him back his brother Henry. After Eddie made sure the deal was the same he asked if he could go to the bathroom, but Balazar said if only Jack would go with just to make sure. So while in the bathroom Eddie, with the help of Roland, got rid of Jack and also thought of a plan to get Eddie out of his situation alive. The plan was that Roland would go back with Eddie and help out. When they got back Balazar was mad and thus begun a shoot out where the end result was basically everyone dead except Roland and Eddie. Roland told Eddie that they had to go back to his world after what happened.  Once back in Roland's world both of them slept and then continued on the journey for the other two and of course the Dark Tower. In the time that Eddie and Roland continued on the beach they both shared stories about their lives. Also they had to make sure not to get eaten by the lobster like creatures that came up from the sea at night. Roland explained to Eddie they were now known as a ka, or two or more people who share the same destiny. After what seemed like weeks, well more like months they came upon the second door and just like Eddies door there was something written on it only this time it said ""The Lady of Shadows"".  Behind this door were Odetta Holmes and Detta Walker who are one in the same person, well more like a person with two personalities. Odetta Holmes was the nice and refined personality of the two. Detta Walker was the rougher one who you would hope was on your side in a fight. When Roland said he was going to go through the door Eddie said he would kill him. So Roland went though and got Odetta/Detta and when they returned Eddie was hovering over Roland's body with a knife at his throat. After a while Odetta asked where she was and why so Eddie calmly explained it to her as best as he could. After which Odetta thought she was in a coma and that she was just dreaming. But Eddie told her she wasn't and she should give it a shot and not give up.  That night Detta walker decided to show up and instead of Odetta waking up it was her.  So for a couple days Eddie and Roland had to put up with Detta Walker. So they moved on with Detta Walker tied down to the wheelchair just to make sure she didn't attempt to kill them while they slept. As they progressed along the beach Odetta and Detta would switch places. The going was easier with Odetta then with Detta who would try and topple the wheel chair. They came to the end of the seaside beach after a couple of weeks. After a short while Roland's condition became worse and worse so told Eddie to go on and find the third door then come back to get him. And along the way Odetta and Eddie fell in love. So after Eddie and Odetta found the third door Eddie went back to get Roland so he could go through it.  When Eddie and Roland got back to where Odetta had been she was now gone along with the gun Eddie left her with. And so Roland prepared to go through the third door which was inscribed with the words ""The Pusher"" on it. So Roland went through the door and entered the mind of Jack Mort, who just so happens to be the person who caused Jake to die and be sent to Roland's world. And while Roland was in Jack's mind he saved Jake from being killed by him. Roland also ""picked"" at Jack's mind and found out where he could get more medicine and bullets for his guns.  Back in Roland's world Eddie was keeping a sharp eye out for Detta Walker because she wanted to kill him. Soon Detta snuck up on Eddie and then tied him up and was planning on using him as bait to get a lobster like creatures. Now back to Roland who while that was going on went to a drugstore to get the medicine he needed. Afterwards was being chased down by the police for holding up the drugstore to get the medicine he needed. When Roland was about to have Jack jump off a building he told Eddie to have Detta look through the doorway. When she did she saw Odetta looking back at her and Odetta saw Detta looking back at her.  After Odetta and Detta saw each other they had a struggle of wills so to speak which neither was victorious but they found an equal state between them. Now she was Susannah Dean, the wife of Eddie who was a mix of Odetta and Detta. So they went on their way in search for the third person on their quest for the dark tower."	5407
1101946342	A33XCW3R9CEEJN	False	06 18, 2015	1434585600	1.0	746	 Paperback	Makes Christian seem half-witted	"And so, here it is. The new doorstopper of a book by E.L. James, meant to give us insight into Christian Greys thoughts. And boy, does it ever do that. Way, way too much.  To be more exact, for every sentence of dialogue, plot or exposition, theres at least two--and more likely, three or four--sentences of inner monologuing and Christians every feeling and thought being spelled out for the reader. In this book, E. L. James never shows us what the protagonist feels if she can tell us instead. Say what you like about the way that, in the original trilogy, Ana constantly told the reader about her blushing and lip-biting, but at least there wasn't this constant stream of consciousness. Its a pain to try to get through. Every time a character moves a muscle, Christians narration offers a comment. Its as if its the Super Bowl finals on TV and a motor-mouthed commentator is doing his best to keep up with the action, except sports commentators tend to be good at what they're doing. One of the good things about the portrayal of Christian in the original trilogy was the way that you never could feel completely certain about what was going on in the mind of this young entrepeneur. He was an enigma wrapped in a riddle inside an Armani suit. But now that weve gotten this insight into his mind, we see that whats inside isn't very impressive. For a man whos supposed to be smart enough to create an enormous business empire at such a relatively young age, he definitely doesnt give us a very intelligent impression. That's something that James should have kept in mind--if your point-of-view character is supposed to be brilliant in some way, then you need to be able to actually provide him with brilliant things to think and say. Having him use a sophisticated tone is not the same thing as actually having anything intelligent to say in that tone.  (That reminds me a bit of what I regarded as one of the biggest problems in the original trilogyAna was supposed to be an English major, but she never offered any actual insights about the literature she loved. She seemed less like someone whod analyzed classic novels, and more like somebody who just had read them at some point.)  Oh, and one weird detail--you know how Christian quotes Harvey Firestone, saying The growth and development of people is the highest calling of leadership"" in the original Fifty Shades of Grey? Well, for some reason this bok has cut away the part where he correctly attributes the quote to Firestone, and instead the inner monologue has him incorrectly ascribe it to Andrew Carnegie. Im not sure how James could make such a mistake, but she did. Another sign of shoddy workmanship is when Ana asks Christian if hes gay, and he narrates that its ironic that Ana asks the question even my own family will not ask. Thing is.... thats not ironic. That one person asks a question that another person doesnt ask is not ironic. Absurd? A bit. Unexpected? Sure. Ironic? No, Alanis, its not. The book is full of little errors like that--things that don't make sense if you pause to think about them for just one second. Like when, in the original, Ana narrated that Christian's voice was ""husky, like chocolate,"" even though not even the Swiss have ever made chocolate that's husky.  Yet another problem is that since every single one of Christians emotions is spelled out, it feels like James regards her readers as idiots. For instance, you know that part where Ana comments that the paintings in Christians office are raising the ordinary to extraordinary? Here, Christian narrates that Its a keen observation. Then, he adds Miss Steele is bright, just in case we didn't get that from his remark about her observation being keen. Which it wasnt, by the way. And it doesnt become keen just because were told it is. Not to mention that its a bit jarring, the way he says shes bright in a scene where she doesn't really do or say anything that would give you an impression of intelligence. But the plot dictates that Christians supposed to be impressed by Ana's intelligence, so he will be, darn it, regardless of whether hes got a reason to be or not.  Still, you gotta give this book credit for how environmentally friendly it is. Its full of recycling. Recycled plot, recycled characters, recycled dialogue--James mustve had a breeze, not having to come up with new things to write. But reading it was no breeze. To be honest, I couldn't make it longer than about seventy pages or so; Christians constant inane commentary was just too exasperating. Sorry, Ms. James, but Ill sit this one out. Keep the recycling to glass, metal and paper, please.  P.S. For some reason, a few people who hear complaints about the reused plot tend to reply ""Well, what did you expect? The entire point of the book is to retell the story from Christian's point of view!"" I'd like to inform these people that as I started reading, I was fully aware that this book was meant to do that. But what matters isn't whether I expected a re-used plot. What matters is whether a re-used plot is fun to read or not. And since this particular re-used plot wasn't fun to read, I'm obviously not going to give it a good review. It's that simple. Not to mention that you CAN retell a plot without repeating every. darn. line. of. dialogue.  (EDIT: And let also add that the parts where we get first-person flashbacks to Christian as a child are written in a completely stilted and unnatural tone. It doesn't sound like a real child at all.)"	5492
1101991674	AIML3W4Y9R31D	False	09 6, 2016	1473120000	1.0	9	 Paperback	Forced chemistry and awkward writing. Sad this didnt work for me.	"* I received an advance copy and the audiobook from the publisher in exchange for an honest review. Audiobook comments are below. I switched back and forth between the eBook and the audiobook.  The One Real Thing is the first in Samantha Young's new contemporary romance series, Hart's Boardwalk.  I've been looking forward to reading this, especially since I've really enjoyed most of Young's previous novels. It pains me to say that The One Real Thing missed the mark almost entirely, for reasons I will explain below.  This novel is set in a small coastal town where everyone knows each other's business. After uncovering letters hidden away for forty years that were never delivered, Dr. Jessica Huntington decides to seek out the intended recipient and provide closure. This leads her Hartwell, Delaware. There, she must face the ghosts of her past while she deciding what she wants out of her life and unexpectedly falls in love with the town, its people, and the cute bar owner, Cooper.  There is one common thread in many of Young's books: her writing has an ease and flow to it. That trait was not found in this book. In fact, as I read I couldn't see her literary fingerprint in this novel at all. None of the characters were compelling, interesting, or particularly memorable (it really hurts to say this). The way it was written felt unnatural and awkward at times.  Perhaps the most problematic element, as this is a romance, was the relationship between Jessica and Cooper. It was completely forced, hurried, and lacking in chemistry and tension. It felt so heavy-handed. There was entirely too much telling, almost like the author wanted to convince the reader that there was romantic chemistry. The reader is bombarded with repeated mentions of the ""zings,"" the ""tingles,"" and signals to various body parts. But I didn't buy or feel any romantic tension or build up at all.  ""Cooper felt what was almost like a warning tingle on the back of his neck. And it wasn't the cold.""  ""The doc was someone worth getting to know. He felt it in that damn tingle.""  ""Just as he was about to hurry up the boards, he felt that tingle...""  ""That tingle shot down his spine. His blood turned hot.""  ""My insides went mushy at the compliment. I was glad he'd felt the zinging between us, too.""  ""Every time his arm accidentally brushed mine it was like his touch sent signals to my breasts, and my breasts sent shooting tingles down my stomach to between my thighs.""  Regarding the awkward writing, after a briefly meeting Jessica twice, Cooper is already making presumptions about her stating, ""she was probably an independent woman and [he] had never dated a woman like that before"" and ""Jessica struck him as a different sort of woman...Not only did she probably take care of herself, she took care of other people."" What? You got that she was independent and strong based on a couple of short encounters? And let's not forget the repeated uses of ""chuckling,"" ""chortling,"" and ""guffawing"" in this novel.  In the first few pages alone, I lost count how many times the heroine made note of the hero's blue eyes or the fact that he was wearing a blue flannel shirt.  ""Warm blue eyes met mine. Blue, blue eyes. Like the Aegean Sea that surrounded Santorini.""  Cooper was just as enamored with Jessica's brown eyes as she was with his blue ones. In fact, the trend of ""gazing into each others' eyes"" was almost a literary theme in this book, it was so overused. It did nothing to build chemistry or the romance for me.  To save herself the time of calling him ""blue-eyed, rugged, flannel guy,"" Jessica decides to internally abbreviate his nickname to ""BRF guy."" Seriously? Jessica's voice was that of a teenager when we're supposed to believe she's a thirty-three year old woman. She likes to have sex when she's feeling ""fris-frisky"" and calls the act of sex ""a little something something."" Let's not forget the ""prehistoric-dragonfly-sized butterflies"" she gets at one point.  Jessica is harboring a secret, one that she is afraid to tell anyone. This is a source of conflict for the bookopening up to Cooper. Once the secret was revealed, it didn't make sense at all why she was afraid to tell Cooper this in the first place.  In an effort to create the feel of a small town, the author had to introduce the reader to the people of Hartwell. The characters were dumped on the reader at a rapid pace, rather than being organically introducedIris and Ira, Vaughn, Ollie, Hug, Shelley, Paulie, Cat, Bailey, Mona, Old Archie, Dana, Emery, Riley, Jack, Lily, Kit, Jace, Crosby, Isla, Bryn, and many more.  I really wanted to believe what the author wanted me tobe charmed by the town and its townsfolk, fall in love with Jessica and Cooper, sympathize with Jessica's reluctance to reveal her dark secret. But I wasn't able to. In all honesty, there were very few things in this novel I liked. One of the things I did enjoy was simmering chemistry between a couple of the side characters. I have high hopes that the second novel featuring these two characters will deliver in the ways this one didn't.  Audiobook Comments: I switched back and forth between the book and audiobook while reading this one. I hadn't heard an audiobook narrated by either Tad Branson or Angelica Lee before. Tad Branson did a really great job differentiating between all of the different characters. Usually a guy doing a female voice sounds a little hokey but Tad's ""Jessica"" voice was actually not annoying. Angelica Lee's delivery was good. Though her ""Cooper"" voice was a little over-the-top with its husky, bedroom tone. These narrators were great at 2x speed, too!"	5644
