I did not know what to expect, being accustomed to scholarly texts that make you think deeply on a subject rather than having a text that makes you think, but also has an interesting storyline to entertain you at the same time.   This historical non-fiction is a story about a Nicanor, a man who was a slave at one time, but bought his freedom from his master, Erastos, in first century Corinth. I enjoyed it because in the middle of the storyline, I could learn some things that pertained to the culture and times of first century Corinth.   When Paulos (Paul) was introduced into the storyline, my ears perked up. Not only was this a story of a free man and a description of life in Corinth, but also the gospel was very vivid.   My only dislike was the fact that the dialogue between the characters did not flow very well. The 7-year-old girl's (Julia) vocabulary was very developed, at times, not believable. Sometimes the phrases seemed Americanized and not """"Corinthian"""" (?) enough. I had a good laugh when Krackus, the gladiator, said, """"I suppose it would be wise to get out while the getting is good."""" (110) Ha!   These dislikes are only semantics, though, and really did not distract from the purpose of the book, which was to show the reader what life was like in first century Corinth.   Corinthian culture, a trial, another man driven by envy, a sick man in need of healing, gospel proclamation... and even romantic love all seems to take part in this story. Recommended, indeed!   The author writes, """"In short, the story in this book, while fiction, is based in the historical realities of the Corinthian Christian community that Paul founded."""" -158   Here are some quotes:   """"The captain had offered the morning sacrifice, a young sea bird caught at dawn, and the auspices were propitious."""" -7   """" 'Yet the characteristic vices peculiar to our city seem to be inculcated and almost in the mother's womb, that is the enthusiasm for acting, and the passion for gladiators and racing. In a mind preoccupied by such things, what little space is left for the higher arts?' """" (Tacitus) -11   """"It was Julius Caesar in about 44 B.C. who made ancient Corinth into the Roman colony city of Corinth, Colonia Laus lulia Corinthiensis."""" -15   """"Even for Nicanor the pull of temptation was strong, to take revenge, to throw himself in the arms of Nemesis and strike back against the family who had ripped him from the arms of his father those many years ago."""" -19   """"Unlike cities such as Delphi, well up in the mountains, Corinth enjoyed the benefits of the moderating sea breezes in the summer and the warming current in the winter."""" -27   """"[Paul] had been well-educated at the feet of Gamaliel and in the school of Greek rhetoric and philosophy in Jerusalem."""" -34   """"In the Syriac text of the second century apocryphal document called the Acts of Paul and Thecla, Paul is described as follows: 'He was a man of middling size, an his hair was scanty, and his legs were a little crooked, and his knees were projecting, and he had large eyes and his eyebrows met, and his nose was somewhat long, and he was full of grace and mercy; at one time he seemed like a man, and at another time he seemed like an angel.' This description is the basis of the early drawing of Paul found in a cave above the city of Ephesus used for worship, high above ancient Ephesos."""" -36   """"There is something contradictory about a person who claims to be a seer, and who has visions of heaven, but who has oozing eyes... In short, Paul had some hurdles to overcome as the apostle to a Gentile world that was saturated with rhetoricians and apt to judge orators by their appearance."""" -44   """"And at the very back of the house, beyond and below the main garden, slaves were washing and bleaching the clothes, using the cleaning agent of choice, human urine"""" -45   """"Nicanor knew there was no gainsaying the mistress of the house - she was de facto the oikonomos, ruler of the house, with the consent of her husband."""" -54   """"Giving Nicanor a quick hug, she said, 'I thank the Lord you have returned. We need you at times like these.' There it was again, that talk about not a lord, but 'the Lord.' Nicanor didn't know what to think. How could she be so confident there was only one?"""" -75   """"Born around 460 B.C. on the island of Cos during the golden age of Greece, Hippocrates is known today as the father of modern clinical medicine, and the modern medical Hippocratic Oath is named after him."""" -80   """"An average of 137 persons per acre, in these neighborhoods you were liable to see every imaginable form, shape and condition of humanity."""" -113   """"The stench of the streets was not much of an issue for Nicanor except when the spring thermals blew up the hill from the Adriatic."""" -113   """"Paulos no longer regularly observed the Sabbath, except when he was in the company of Jews who did so, and so when the day of Saturn dawned, he could be found in the leather-working shop, sewing away on yet another tent."""" -118   """"Most of the meat had come from sacrifices in one or another of the temples in Corinth, and already a problem had begun to brew between the more high-status Gentile converts like Erastos, who saw no problem with dining in the temple of Aesclepius and elsewhere, and those like the family of Crispus, who still observed Jewish customs and would not eat 'meat offered to idols,' even at home like Erastos's. Paulos was going to have to give some instructions on these matters to the house churches in Corinth before it led to major divisions in the body of Christ."""" -119   """"...'Salvation' in the pagan mind almost always referred to something hapenning in the world, in this life, of direct material benefit."""" -121   """" 'Yes, mistress,' he replied, 'but right now I am in need of a huge goblet of unwatered wine please.' Tyche laughed and said, 'Coming right up. But you have just drunk in the new wine of the gospel, of life and life abundant in the Lord Jesus, and that will help you much more.' Just when Nicanor thought he was getting a handle on his new direction in life, then this had to happen!"""" -124   """"The meeting of the followers of Jesus would begin at the eleventh hour, or near sunset, just after all the workers and slaves were finished with work for the day. And there would be some from the other house churches who would arrive late to the meeting."""" -125   """"If we were to examine Paul's household codes closely, we would discover that his strategy in dealing with slavery is to put the leaven of the gospel into the structure of the Christian household ad house-church meetings, and let it work its way."""" -128   """"What we see is Paul insisting that Christians who are masters act like Christians first, and this meant all sorts of restrictions on how they treated their slaves... If the master worked out the logical implications of Paul's teaching, he would have to conclude that ultimately manumission was the right Christian way to treat slave in the long run."""" -129   """"Torches had been rigged on poles in the courtyard, and people were enjoying all sorts of rich appetizers, including imported Lucrene oysters and the best Falernian wine. Krackus remarked, 'Your friends really know how to throw a party.' """" -140   """"Would the most high God really exalt and praise this person Christ for dying on a cross? It was one thing to make a hero like Herakles a demi-god. But a Jew like this Jesus? This totally inverted the normal notions of honor and shame, and of what the gods thought was praiseworthy behavior."""" -148   """"It was, of course, customary after a meal to have wine, and to have an after-dinner speaker. And some of those present had refilled and brought their goblets with them into the courtyard, prepared to listen."""" -149   """" 'So I ask you to bear with me friends for a while, as I extol this sort of love.' """" -151"""

'We must have known each other in a former life. Fate keeps on bringing us together.'   'We keep on meeting because you keep hunting me down,' she said with a scowl   He lifted his head and gave her a look that bordered on fondness.""""   Face it, Han. Li Feng is just not into you.   We all have our favorite authors, those to whom we can turn for an excellent, always enjoyable read after the inevitable glut of terrible books. In the historical romance genre, some authors whose works I have almost always enjoyed have been Julia Quinn, Lisa Kleypas...and up until now, Jeannie Lin. It's inevitable that an author eventually publishes a bad book...but it is disappointing nevertheless. It's been such a sad year for me, my failproof authors are no longer immune to bad writing. I shouldn't use the word bad since this book is not bad. It's just not good, in light of her other works, which has been in every way superior to this. It barely qualifies as a romance novel. The romance is awkward, forced, a second thought. It is a commentary on the moral, political, and social system during the Tang dynasty. The romance does not ring true. It is just not there.   Unlike her previous books where the main characters are aristocratic or noble, the characters in this book are quite solidly in the dregs of society. Li Feng is a thief who alternates as a sword-dancer, or rather, anything that she can get away with. Han is a thief catcher, a hated character, seen as little more than a mercenary; he has a strong sense of justice and is duty-bound to hunt down Li Feng...only to fall inexplicably in love with her instead. Inexplicable is the word of the day here. I hesitate to use the word insta-love, because it's such a recurring event in historical romance. It happens every time, but it feels so utterly forced here. In her other books, the romance plays a major role, while here, it is more of an afterthought. More prevalent is the socio-political message pervasive throughout the book through Han's point of view on his straight and narrow path for justice.   The heroine is almost TSTL. For someone who has been on her own since a child, living with a ragtag band of wannabe Robin Hoods and thieves, she is surprisingly stupid. After she gets caught and barely escapes...first thing Li Feng does is run? No. She goes to a jade shop to enquire about the carving on jade talisman she owns because it belonged to her mysterious mother---and inevitably gets hunted down right there. It's not suspicious or anything CONSIDERING SHE'S UNDER SUSPICION AS A JEWEL THIEF.   She is flighty, literally. The plot of the book goes somewhat like this: Li Feng is on the run/in disguise, Han catches Li Feng, Li Feng manages to escape, Han catches Li Feng, Li Feng slips off yet again, Han catches up with her. Repeat. For. The. Entire. Book. Han initially seems like a level-headed, rational character, therefore it is so puzzling to me that he seems determined to pursue Li Feng and try to build upon a relationship that just isn't there. I have to admit it is a change of pace to see a genuinely nice guy fall in love with a wayward girl, as opposed to the thousands of Regency rakes who seem intent on seducing and then running away, but Han's dogged pursuit of Li Feng borders on the unrealistic.   """"Li Feng was still trying to escape.   She trusted him enough to set aside her sword. She even trusted him enough to wrap herself around him as they lay naked, but that was only her body. He knew she still didn't trust him. Han didn't know if Li Feng could ever completely trust anyone.""""   He just doesn't know when to let go. He is the son of a magistrate, despite his current career, and it has always been ingrained in him that justice is black and white. Criminals are to be brought in and tried before the law. The law is never wrong. The law is justice. Of course, the Tang dynasty is no more or less corrupt than any other era in history, but Han wants to believe in the law, in order, that justice will be meted out eventually. Order is the intended state of things, if there is no order, society will lie in ruins. His job as thief catcher is important to him because it helps him fulfil his strong sense of moral justice. Even as he falls in love with Li Feng, he has to justify it to himself that he is pursuing a noble cause and that she must be innocent despite what the authorities say.   """"'I know who you are, Zheng Hao Han,' she challenged. 'You believe in upholding the law, yet you've taken a liking to me. So you've told yourself I must be innocent, because how could Thief-catcher Han ever befriend a common criminal?'""""   The plot, however, is long-winded, repetitive, and overly complicated. The romance aspect is not well-developed enough for it to be a romance novel, it reads more like a historical detective series at times, and their relationship felt to me more like camaraderie than true love. It's a good book, but didn't quite reach its potential. The barely-there courtship is not quite believable, but man, that ending brought a lump to my throat. IT'S SO SWEET.   """"Their hands remained linked as they sat on the roof, side by side, to stare at the sky above. The first stars were out and a stream of lights formed overhead as the night descended.   'I'm dreaming,' she said to the heavens."""""""
